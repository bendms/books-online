## Review : 

This is my first Python projet for OpenClassRooms courses. 

In this scenario we work for an online librairy and we need to create a script which scrap a competitor website to find informations about their books. 

This script will automatically scrap their website from an URL. Find all the categories, find all the books in these categories and create a CSV file for each of them. 

Also, this script will download all cover pictures in .jpg format. 

## Installation : 

This script needs Python installed and some packages detailled in requirements.txt. 

1. Clone the repo with your terminal 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bendms/books-online.git
```
## Configuration : 

1. Install packages from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
2. Run the script using Python commande in terminal : 
```bash
python books-online.py
```
## How to Contribute

This script takes time to be executed. Find ways to improve performances : 

- Use multithreading
- Use LXML or CSS attribute to find HTML tags
